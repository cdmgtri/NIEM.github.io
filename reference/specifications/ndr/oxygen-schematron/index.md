title: Schematron validation in Oxygen XML Editor
short: Oxygen and Schematron
description: Use Oxygen to test a XML schema for NDR conformance.
---

[Oxygen XML Editor]({{ site.data.links.oxygen }}) is a commercial tool that provides a Schematron-validation capability that can be used to test NDR conformance of XML schemas.

{:.note}
> [ConTesA]({{ site.data.pages.contesa }}) is a free web tool provided by the NIEM program that also may be used to check NDR conformance.

## Setup

Download the NDR schematron rules.  These are available in the [NDR zip file]({{ site.data.links.ndr_folder }}) and on the [NDR GitHub repo]({{ site.data.links.ndr_repo}}).

Schematron files have a `.sch` file extension.

The Schematron file(s) will be needed each time you test NDR conformance.  The two key files for this task are:

- `ndr-rules-conformance-target-ext.sch` - Schematron rules for EXT schemas
- `ndr-rules-conformance-target-ref.sch` - Schematron rules for REF schemas

## Schematron Validation

- Open a NIEM XML REF or EXT schema in Oxygen.
- Choose one of several ways to "Validate with..."
  - Document > Validate > Validate with...
  - Click the drop-down on the `Validate` (checkmark) button and select `Validate with...`

  - From an open Oxygen project, right-click on or more selected schema files or folders

- In the `Validate with` dialog box...
  - Change the `Schema Type` field from `XML Schema` to `Schematron`.

  - In the `URL` field, browse to the downloaded Schematron file.  Make sure to choose the appropriate file (REF or EXT) for your NIEM schema.

## Review Conformance Errors

Conformance errors and warnings will appear in the `Results` panel.

{:.note}
- The NDR rule number appears, along with the rule title, so that the NDR may be easily referenced for more information about the rule.
- Double-click on an error or warning to jump to that line in the schema.

The image below shows several modifications to a local copy of Core in order to demonstrate errors:

After making corrections, rerun the steps above to test conformance on the updated schema.
