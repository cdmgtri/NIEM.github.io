The **[Schema Subset Generation Tool (SSGT)]({{ site.data.links.ssgt }})** enables you to search and explore the content of the NIEM model. Additionally, you have the option of building XML Schema subsets of a NIEM release for use in NIEM XML exchanges. Based on the list of components selected by you for the subset, the tool will calculate dependencies and generate a valid set of schemas that are a subset of a release for download as a zip file.

{:.features}
- Search and explore the content of NIEM
- Build XML Schema subsets of a release
  - Automatic management of component dependencies
  - Customize cardinality and nillable values
- Multi-release support
- API for selecting NIEM subset components (wantlist)

{:.note}
> A NIEM subset will contain only the user-selected elements and types from a release, plus any required dependencies. The subset will likely be much smaller than the corresponding full NIEM release.
