## ConTesA Report

The [Conformance Testing Assistance (ConTesA)]({{ site.data.pages.contesa }}) checks uploaded schemas against Schematron rules from the [Naming and Design Rules (NDR)]({{ site.data.pages.ndr }}).

## Additional validation steps

Additional information can also be included specifying any additional steps that were taken to manually review and validate rules that are not automated, like free-text rules from the [Naming and Design Rules (NDR)]({{ site.data.pages.ndr }}) and the [Model Package Description (MPD) Specification]({{ site.data.pages.mpd }}).  See the [MPD Specification, Appendix D. Conformance Assertion Example]({{ site.data.links.mpd_spec}}#appendix_D) for more on what this might look like.
