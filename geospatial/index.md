## Using GML with NIEM

The role and utility of geospatial technology continues to increase along with the amount of information containing geotags (address, latitude/longitude, location). To meet this growing demand, NIEM developed geospatial exchange capabilities that leverage Geography Markup Language (GML) standards established by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). By combining NIEM with GML, mission partners benefit from shared access to the common operating data and services used within these geospatial systems. NIEM is working with members of the community who have leveraged GML in NIEM exchange development. Please contact us if you have examples of how you’re using NIEM and GML.

## Geo4NIEM Initiative

The Geospatial Enhancement for NIEM (Geo4NIEM) initiative enhances NIEM's geospatial exchange capabilities by demonstrating and providing enterprise NIEM-conformant content in a map visualization context that:

- Provided the appropriate security markings and access controls to ensure the right people have access to the right information at the right time in the right context.
- Can be reused across the public and private sector.
- Promoted cost-savings (through use of NIEM and OGC community open standards).

## Geo4NIEM Efforts

There have been two major Geo4NIEM efforts:
